          <p class="service-text">Volunteering has always been a major part of my life. Whether it was during Hurricane Harvey or just simply a project for Boy Scouts I have had years of experience volunteering and helping the community.</p>
          <p class="service-text">While Hurricane Harvey happened a little under a decade ago I will never forget the impacts it had on my neighborhood and all the other affected cities. Many people came together every single day in order to collect supplies and distribute them to those who needed them. Being able to be a part of that group really fueled my passion for helping and helped me carry on this mentality throughout my life.</p>
          <p class="service-text">After Harvey, I started to be more active when it came to volunteering. Luckily for me, opportunities were always being advertised because I was in Boy Scouts. Boy Scouts of America has provided me with countless opportunities to go out and serve my community and I am grateful to have been able to make a difference in the world. Most of my volunteer hours were spent helping older scouts with their Eagle project. It was amazing to be able to physically build something and see its positive effects on whichever organization it was donated to. Eventually, when I was older, I got the chance to host my eagle project for the Houston Arboretum & Nature Center. With the help of some of the adults as well as the younger scouts in my troop, we were able to build and install a water pipeline underground. This new water line prevented any of the coyotes or other animals from messing up the water line and helped the rangers from having to replace the hose they used to use every week. Overall this project was a huge success and is still in use to this day.</p>
