          <p class="about-text">Howdy! I am a <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html" target="_blank"> computer science major </a> at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Texas A&M University.</a> I am class of 2026 and I am working toward a double minor in cybersecurity and statistics. On top of that I am an active member in a high impact program called Aggies in Tech, through this program I have been able to network with various industry professionals as well as work toward a business certificate. When it comes to academics and work I am very interested in machine learning and data science. Both of these fields are constantly growing and their impacts are spreading to almost every other field in the world. This versatility is exactly why I enjoy computer science and especially ML and other AI developemnts. Outside of my academics I am an eagle scout and a member of a social organization known as Philsa. I am extremely passionate about volleyball and I even play for the philsa team. </p>
